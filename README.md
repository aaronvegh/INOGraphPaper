# INOGraphPaper
A Quick 'n' Easy Graph Paper View for iOS

This is a pretty simple custom UIView for showing graph paper. It looks like this:

## Features
* Written in Swift!
* It's an IBDesignable class with Inspectable items. You can change the distance between major and minor lines, and change the colour of those lines, all within Interface Builder.
* There is no third feature!

## How to use
You can download this project and see how it works. To integrate into your own project:

1. Import "GraphPaperView.swift" into your project.
2. In Interface Builder, drop a UIView onto your Storyboard or XIB.
3. Change the Custom Class of the UIView to `GraphPaperView`. 
4. In the Properties palette, set up your distances and colours.
5. There is no step 5!
